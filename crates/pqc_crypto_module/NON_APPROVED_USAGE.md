# Non-Approved Algorithm Usage — pqc_crypto_module v0.1.0

> **Disclaimer**: This module is prepared for FIPS 140-3 evaluation and is not currently validated.

---

## 1. Non-Approved Algorithms

The following algorithms are present in the module for backward compatibility with pre-PQC ledger data. They are **outside the approved cryptographic boundary** and are not available when the module operates in Approved mode.

| Algorithm | Crate | Purpose | FIPS Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ed25519 | `ed25519-dalek 2.1` | Legacy digital signatures (pre-PQC blocks, wallets) | Not approved |
| SHA-256 | `sha2 0.10` | Legacy block hashing | Not approved for this module |
| HMAC-SHA256 | `hmac 0.12` + `sha2 0.10` | Legacy MAC operations | Not approved for this module |

**Note**: SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA256 are NIST-approved algorithms in general, but they are not part of this module's approved algorithm set. All approved hashing uses SHA3-256 (FIPS 202).

## 2. Legacy Functions

All non-approved functions are in `src/legacy.rs`:

| Function | Algorithm | Signature |
|---|---|---|
| `legacy_ed25519_sign(sk, msg)` | Ed25519 | `(&SigningKey, &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, CryptoError>` |
| `legacy_ed25519_verify(pk, msg, sig)` | Ed25519 | `(&[u8; 32], &[u8], &[u8]) -> Result<(), CryptoError>` |
| `legacy_sha256(data)` | SHA-256 | `(&[u8]) -> Result<[u8; 32], CryptoError>` |
| `legacy_hmac_sha256(key, data)` | HMAC-SHA256 | `(&[u8], &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, CryptoError>` |

## 3. Gating Mechanisms

Non-approved algorithms are controlled by two independent mechanisms:

### 3.1 Runtime Guard (`ensure_not_approved()`)

Every legacy function calls `ensure_not_approved()` as its first operation:

```rust
pub fn ensure_not_approved() -> Result<(), CryptoError> {
    match approved_mode::state() {
        ModuleState::Approved => Err(CryptoError::NonApprovedAlgorithm),
        _ => Ok(()),
    }
}
```

**Behavior by module state**:

| Module State | `ensure_not_approved()` | Legacy functions |
|---|---|---|
| `Uninitialized` | `Ok(())` | Available (for pre-migration use) |
| `SelfTesting` | `Ok(())` | Available (transient state) |
| `Approved` | `Err(NonApprovedAlgorithm)` | **Blocked** |
| `Error` | `Ok(())` | Available (but module is degraded) |

When the module is in `Approved` state, any call to a legacy function returns:

```
Err(CryptoError::NonApprovedAlgorithm)
```

No cryptographic computation is performed.

### 3.2 Compile-Time Exclusion (`approved-only` feature flag)

The `legacy.rs` module begins with:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "approved-only")]
compile_error!(
    "Legacy crypto module is disabled in approved-only mode. \
     Remove usage of pqc_crypto_module::legacy::* or disable the approved-only feature."
);
```

When the crate is compiled with `--features approved-only`:

- The `legacy` module emits a compile error.
- Any code that imports or calls `pqc_crypto_module::legacy::*` fails to compile.
- This provides a hard guarantee that no non-approved algorithm is reachable in the binary.

**Usage**:

```bash
# Build with legacy algorithms available (default)
cargo build

# Build with legacy algorithms excluded at compile time
cargo build --features approved-only
```

## 4. Type Re-exports

The `legacy` module also re-exports type-level definitions from the underlying crates for struct compatibility:

| Sub-module | Re-exports |
|---|---|
| `legacy::ed25519` | `SigningKey`, `VerifyingKey`, `Signature`, `Signer`, `Verifier`, `SignatureError` |
| `legacy::sha256` | `Sha256`, `Digest` |
| `legacy::hmac` | `Hmac`, `Mac`, `HmacSha256` |
| `legacy::rng` | `OsRng`, `Rng`, `RngCore`, `SliceRandom`, `rand_core` |
| `legacy::mldsa_raw` | `mldsa65`, `DetachedSignature`, `PublicKey`, `SecretKey` |

These re-exports provide type definitions needed for pattern matching and struct fields in legacy code paths. They do **not** bypass the runtime guard — actual cryptographic operations must go through the guarded functions.

## 5. No Fallback Guarantee

The module is designed with no implicit fallback from approved to non-approved algorithms:

1. If an ML-DSA operation fails (e.g., invalid key), the error is returned directly. There is no fallback to Ed25519.
2. If SHA3-256 is available, SHA-256 is not silently used as an alternative.
3. The approved API (`pqc_crypto_module::api`) does not expose any Ed25519, SHA-256, or HMAC-SHA256 functions.

This is verified by:
- `tests/no_fallback.rs` — confirms no classical fallback on ML-DSA failure.
- `tests/approved_vs_legacy.rs` — confirms legacy is blocked in Approved mode and no implicit fallback occurs.

## 6. Migration Path

The intended migration path for Cerulean Ledger:

1. **Phase 1 (current)**: Both approved and legacy algorithms available. Legacy used only for verifying pre-existing blocks.
2. **Phase 2**: All new operations use approved algorithms. Legacy used only for historical verification.
3. **Phase 3**: Build with `--features approved-only` to eliminate legacy code from the binary entirely.

At Phase 3, the only algorithms in the compiled binary are ML-DSA-65, ML-KEM-768, and SHA3-256.

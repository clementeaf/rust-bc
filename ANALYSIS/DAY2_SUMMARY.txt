✅ DAY 2 COMPLETE (5 hours)
=========================

DELIVERABLE:
- 04_NEURO_ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md (572 lines)

ANALYSIS COMPLETED:
✅ NeuroAccessMaui architecture study (2.5 hours)
✅ Tech stack comparison (2 hours)
✅ Integration patterns identified (0.5 hours)

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. NeuroAccessMaui is production-ready (v2.8.0)
   - 977 C# + XAML files
   - 20+ XMPP packages
   - 9 languages, 3 platforms

2. rust-bc + NeuroAccessMaui = Complementary
   - rust-bc: Backend consensus engine
   - NeuroAccessMaui: Frontend client app
   - Hybrid pattern via REST bridge (RECOMMENDED)

3. NeuroAccessMaui advantages:
   - Full MVVM architecture (70% less boilerplate)
   - Biometric authentication
   - Smart contracts + currency
   - 2+ years production deployment

4. Legal barrier identified:
   - Neuro-Foundation License (commercial use requires licensing)
   - Workaround: Use reference architecture, implement independently

5. Viable integration paths:
   - Pattern A: Keep rust-bc backend, add NeuroAccessMaui-inspired UI
   - Pattern B: Hybrid via REST/HTTP bridge
   - Pattern C: Phased migration to Neuron protocol

PHASE 1 PROGRESS:
- Day 1: ✅ 4.5 hours
- Day 2: ✅ 5.0 hours
- Subtotal: 9.5/20 hours (47.5% complete)
- Remaining: 10.5 hours (Days 3-5)

NEXT: Day 3 - Target Architecture Design

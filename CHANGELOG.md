## [Unreleased]

### 2026-05-15

**Cerulean Voto — Acta blockchain anchoring + vote secrecy**

- Actas anchored on-chain: SHA-256 hash stored as identity record (`did:cerulean:acta:{folio}`) on session close
- Acta UI shows "Anclado" with trace_id instead of "Pendiente de anclaje"
- Vote secrecy via blind voter ID: `blind_id = sha256(proposal_id || voter_did)`
- Real voter identity verified (signature check) but never stored with the vote
- Cross-proposal unlinkability: different blind_id per proposal for same voter
- Backward compatible: unsigned votes (legacy/permissive) use raw voter DID

---

**Cerulean Voto — Real wallet integration (cerulean-wallet WASM)**

- Voter registration now generates a real Ed25519 wallet via cerulean-wallet WASM (Argon2id + AES-256-GCM)
- DID derived deterministically from public key (`did:cerulean:{sha256(pk)[0..20]}`)
- Vote signing: voter enters passphrase, vote payload signed with Ed25519 private key
- Backend signature verification: governance handler verifies Ed25519 signature + DID-to-pubkey binding
- Voter selector dropdown (no free-text) — only registered wallets can vote
- Passphrase input for decrypting wallet at vote time — wrong passphrase shows clear error
- Vote receipt shows signature fragment as cryptographic proof
- WASM module copied from cerulean-wallet (same crypto as CLI — wallets cross-compatible)

---

**Cerulean Voto — Voter registry persistence, padron validation, agenda-election linking**

- Voter registry (padron) persisted in localStorage — survives page refresh
- Vote page validates voter against registered padron before allowing vote
- Voter bar shows registration status: "Habilitado" (green), "No registrado" (red)
- Session agenda items of type "votacion" can link to a governance proposal via dropdown
- Linked elections shown as badge in session detail drawer
- Removed dead code: `PageIntro` component, 5 unused types, 2 unused API functions

---

- ISO 8601: all dates and timestamps in standard format
- Auto-generated acta on session close with all legally required fields
- Admin panel: org settings, signatory management, quorum config, normativa reference, export/import backup

- API client: `listCredentials()` function

---

**Digital Identity module — Document signing with legal validity**

- `/identity` rewritten as institutional digital identity module: identities list + signed documents panel + document detail drawer
- Documents presented as contracts, titles, certificates — not technical credentials
- Each document shows: signer, date, status (Vigente/Expirado/Revocado), content, and cryptographic proof (ML-DSA-65, SHA-256, blockchain seal)
- Backend: `list_identities()` added to `BlockStore` trait, `MemoryStore`, and `RocksDbBlockStore`; `GET /api/v1/store/identities` endpoint
- `/demo` (RRHH verification) redesigned: horizontal step indicator, single active card, compact layout without scrollbar
- Layout: sidebar groups Red and Tokens hidden for institutional focus
- API client: `listIdentities()` function, `Credential` type extended with `claims` and `status` fields

---

**Identity & Governance Hardening — Zero-panic, bounded, validated**

- Governance handlers: 6 `unwrap()` replaced with proper 503 error responses (zero panic paths)
- Tally arithmetic: `saturating_add`/`saturating_mul` on all vote power accumulation (overflow-safe)
- Voting period: `saturating_add` on `voting_ends_at` calculation
- Identity: hex decode fallback removed — invalid hex returns 400 instead of silent bypass
- Input limits: proposer/voter/delegate max 256B, description max 4KB, title max 256B, param changes max 50 entries
- Empty string rejection: voter, proposer, delegator, delegate, veto caller all validated non-empty
- Semantic param validation: quorum/threshold 1-100, voting_period > 0
- Issuer DID existence check before credential issuance (both `issue_credential` and `store_write_credential`)
- Stress tests: `stress_identity` (DID write+read cycle) and `stress_credential` (credential write+read cycle) added — 10 modules total
- Pentest suite: 33 → 40 scenarios. New: oversized description, empty voter, quorum=0, credential without issuer, vote spam (1000 votes), delegation cycle, signature bypass via invalid hex. All BLOCKED.
- Tests: 1687 passed, 0 critical vulnerabilities

---

**Institutional Integrity Dashboard — Flagship monitoring panel**

- New page `/integridad` — real-time platform integrity dashboard for institutional stakeholders
- 8 horizontal service cards: Security (pentest), Forensic (hash chain), Compliance (21 regulatory checks), Cryptography (PQC/KAT), Storage (RocksDB), Consensus (BFT/validators), Oracles (feed freshness), Intelligence (AML/risk)
- Each card opens a slide-in drawer with full service detail (scenarios, checks, metrics, validators)
- Tabbed right panel: integrity report table + security events timeline
- Stress test performance grid (8 modules: ops/s, p99 latency, status)
- Vertical control cards linking to Credentials, Governance, Finance, Contracts subsystems

- Zero new dependencies, zero backend changes — all data from existing 44 monitoring endpoints

---

**Production Readiness — Load testing scripts and audit engagement package**

- `tools/k6/load-test.js` — k6 load test suite: 4 scenarios (default, spike, soak, stress), 8 weighted API actions (health, stats, blocks, mempool, audit, identity, wallet+mine), p95 < 500ms and error rate < 1% thresholds, JSON reports
- `docs/SECURITY-AUDIT-ENGAGEMENT.md` — complete engagement package for external auditor: scope (10 components prioritized), architecture summary, crypto inventory (8 algorithms), 6 known risks, internal security work summary, key files for review, environment setup

**Schema Migrations — Versioned RocksDB upgrades on startup**

- `src/storage/migrations.rs` — migration system: schema version in `meta` CF, migration registry with `(version, fn)` entries, runs pending on startup
- Fresh databases stamped at `LATEST_VERSION` (v2) without running migrations
- Existing databases migrate incrementally (v1→v2 verifies new CFs exist)
- Idempotent: crash mid-migration re-runs same step on next startup
- Wired in `main.rs` — migrations run before serving requests, fatal on failure
- 6 unit tests: fresh DB, v1→v2, idempotent, version survives reopen, sorted order

**Graceful Shutdown — Real WAL flush and full task cleanup**

- `RocksDbBlockStore::flush_wal()` — flushes WAL + memtables to SST files before exit
- Shutdown handler now aborts 5 background tasks (was 3): added pull_sync, antientropy
- Per-phase shutdown logging with elapsed time for operator visibility
- 2 unit tests: flush on empty DB, flush persists writes across reopen

**Consolidation — AppState test builder, cross-subsystem tests, legacy deprecation docs**

- `AppState::test_default()` — single constructor with all memory-backed defaults for tests. Replaces ~50-line duplicated constructors across 6 handler test files + unused imports cleaned up.
- `tests/cross_subsystem.rs` — 7 integration tests crossing module boundaries: identity→credential→audit, chaincode→sandbox→audit, legal oracle→audit, credential→ZKP verification, credential revocation→ZKP invalidation, multi-org audit isolation
- Legacy storage (`src/blockchain.rs`) documented as DEPRECATED with migration path in CLAUDE.md. 17 production refs remain in `api_legacy.rs` — both systems operate independently without conflicts.

**Consolidation — Stubs replaced, honest labeling, real HTTP, RocksDB persistence**

- Identity handlers: `create_identity` generates real DID + Ed25519 keypair + persists to store; `get_identity` reads from store; `rotate_key` updates record; `verify_signature` performs real Ed25519 verification
- Credential handlers: `issue_credential` persists to store; `get_credential` reads from store; `verify_credential` checks status + expiry + revocation; `revoke_credential` updates status with audit event
- ZKP module renamed to "commitment-based attribute verification" — docs honestly state verifier sees claim value
- Legal oracle: stub fetch replaced with real `reqwest::blocking` HTTP client (15s timeout, Bearer auth, error handling)
- RocksDB persistence for 3 new stores: `AuditStore` (CF `audit_log`), `SandboxReportStore` (CF `sandbox_reports`), `OracleRecordStore` (CF `oracle_records`). All use existing Column Family pattern in `adapters.rs`. `SandboxReportStore` refactored from concrete struct to trait (`MemorySandboxReportStore` + `RocksDbBlockStore` impl).

**ZKP for Sovereign Identity — Commitment-based attribute verification**

- `src/identity/zkp.rs` — Commitment-based ZKP: SHA-256(value || blinding) proofs without revealing claim data
- 3 predicates: `RangeProof` (numeric >= threshold), `SetMembership` (value in allowed set), `CredentialValidity` (active, not expired/revoked)
- `prove_range()`, `prove_set_membership()`, `prove_credential_validity()` generate `ZkPresentation`
- `verify_presentation()` validates commitment integrity + predicate satisfaction; rejects tampered proofs
- Endpoints: `POST /identity/zkp/prove`, `POST /identity/zkp/verify`
- Audit events on each verification (result only, no claim data revealed)
- 13 unit tests covering all predicates, boundary cases, and tamper detection

**Legal Oracle — Off-chain legal data queries with on-chain records**

- `src/legal_oracle/mod.rs` — `OracleRecord` (source, query, response_hash, timestamp, signature, summary), `OracleRecordStore` trait + `MemoryOracleRecordStore`, SHA-256 response hashing
- `src/legal_oracle/legal.rs` — `LegalOracle` service: configurable sources, injectable fetch function, TTL cache, response hash verification, JSON summary extraction
- Endpoints: `POST /oracle/legal/query`, `GET /oracle/legal/records`, `GET /oracle/legal/records/{id}`
- Audit event emitted on each query
- 15 unit tests (store CRUD, cache hit/miss, hash verification, fetch errors, summary extraction)

**Forensic Dashboard — Compliance UI in block explorer**

- Compliance page (`/compliance`): audit events table with action/org filters, 5 summary indicators (total, blocks mined, DID mutations, chaincode deploys, failed requests), auto-refresh 10s, color-coded action badges
- ChaincodeHealth page (`/chaincode-health`): sandbox report viewer per chaincode version, pass/fail summary card, per-check detail (well-formedness, import whitelist, memory limits)
- API client: `getAuditEvents()`, `getSandboxReport()` with types `AuditEntry`, `SandboxReport`
- Sidebar: new "Compliance" nav group with Audit Trail and Chaincode Health items

**Chaincode Sandbox — Static validation gate before deployment**

- `src/chaincode/sandbox.rs` — Wasm static analysis: well-formedness (wasmparser), import whitelist (6 allowed host functions), memory limits (max 16 pages / 1 MB)
- Auto-detects WAT text vs binary Wasm
- `SandboxReport` struct with per-check results, wasm size, validation duration
- `SandboxReportStore` in-memory for persisting reports per chaincode version
- Gate in `install_chaincode`: rejects Wasm that fails sandbox with 400 + failure details
- `GET /api/v1/chaincode/{id}/sandbox-report?version=...` — query validation report
- Dependencies: `wasmparser = "0.236"`, `wat = "1.246"`
- 10 unit tests (valid, malformed, forbidden imports, oversized memory, boundary, store)

**Audit — Action-level domain events (ISO 27001 compliance)**

- `AuditEntry.action` field with 16 semantic action types (`AuditAction` enum: `BlockMined`, `DidRegistered`, `ChaincodeInstalled`, etc.)
- `AuditStore::query()` now accepts `action` filter alongside existing `org_id` and time range filters
- `emit_domain_event()` / `emit_if_present()` helpers for emitting audit events from business logic without HTTP context
- Domain audit hooks in 8 mutation handlers: mine_block, create_wallet, stake, install_chaincode, store_write_identity, store_write_credential, create_channel, submit_proposal
- `GET /api/v1/audit/requests?action=block_mined` — query by action type
- CSV export includes action column
- `AuditEntry.metadata` optional field for domain-specific context (block height, DID, chaincode hash, etc.)
- 11 unit tests covering action filtering, combined filters, domain event emission, and display formatting
- Integration roadmap: `docs/ROADMAP-INTEGRACION-CERULEAN.md` — 5 phases derived from Abraxas integration guide, adapted to actual architecture

### 2026-05-10

**Enterprise Sandbox**

- Prometheus + Grafana added to sandbox compose (pre-provisioned dashboard at `:3000`)
- Resource governance: memory/CPU limits on all containers (node 512M, frontends 128M)
- Rich seed data: 7 wallets, 8 blocks, wallet transfers, 2 orgs, 2 channels, 7 DIDs, 5 credentials, governance proposals with votes
- Version tracking: `BUILD_VERSION` from git SHA injected at build time
- Nginx error fallback: branded 502/503 page with 5s auto-retry when node is starting
- SSE event stream proxy through nginx (unbuffered, long-lived connections)
- Multi-org demo: org1 (Universidad de Chile) + org2 (Banco Central), channels `academic` + `financial`
- Backup/restore script: `scripts/sandbox-backup.sh` snapshots RocksDB volume as tarball

**Oracle System Hardening**

- Fix: `aggregate_reports` now filters by symbol (was mixing all pending reports)
- Fix: HMAC signature always verified (removed test-mode bypass for timestamps < 100M)
- Fix: constant-time comparison via `Mac::verify_slice` (prevents timing attacks)
- Fix: external connector uses fixed-point pricing (×10^8) for sub-1 tokens (CLP/USD)
- Fix: `retain` only clears processed symbol's reports (other symbols persist)

**Pentest Suite Expanded (20 → 33 scenarios)**

Network layer attacks (PEN-021 to PEN-023):
- Sybil peer flooding: `MembershipTable` now enforces `MAX_PEERS` cap (default 500), rejects excess
- Malformed P2P messages: serde rejects garbage/truncated/oversized payloads without panic
- Eclipse attack: DAG rejects blocks referencing non-existent parents

EVM adversarial tests (PEN-025, PEN-026, PEN-031, PEN-032):
- Reentrancy: revm enforces 1024 call depth + gas limit
- Storage collision: address-scoped storage isolation verified
- Delegatecall abuse: separate contracts cannot modify each other's state remotely
- Gas bomb: infinite loop + memory expansion halts cleanly at gas limit

Consensus attacks (PEN-027, PEN-028):
- Nothing-at-stake: equivocation detector catches dual-fork proposals, slashing applies
- Long-range reorg: BFT commit QC provides finality; without QC, fork choice acknowledged

Economic attacks (PEN-024, PEN-029, PEN-030, PEN-033):
- Front-running sandwich: MVCC conflict detector separates overlapping txs into waves
- Validator grinding: stake-weighted round-robin gives no advantage to address splitting
- Fee suppression: `MIN_BASE_FEE` floor prevents zero-fee exploitation
- Proposer-MEV: deterministic scheduling + multi-org endorsement prevents extraction

Infrastructure:
- `MembershipTable::with_capacity()` constructor for custom peer limits
- `record_alive_full()` now returns `bool` (false = rejected at capacity)

Tests: 1,629+ passed, 0 critical vulnerabilities.

---

**Oracle Maturation**

- External connector wired in `main.rs` — `ORACLE_SOURCES` env var activates real HTTP price feeds
- New env var `ORACLE_CONNECTOR_SYMBOL` (default `BTC/USD`) selects the feed symbol
- API responses now include `age_ms` and `is_stale` fields for every price feed
- New endpoint: `GET /oracle/status` — node count, feed count, stale/fresh breakdown, pending reports

**Pentest Suite Expanded (15 → 20 scenarios)**

Strengthened existing tests (previously descriptive, now exercise real code):
- PEN-003: Replay attack — `MemoryStore` rejects duplicate block height
- PEN-004: Double-spend — `schedule_batch` detects WAW conflict, separates into sequential waves

New attack scenarios:
- PEN-016: Path traversal in channel names (`../`, null bytes) — HashMap keys are literal, no leakage
- PEN-017: Oracle price manipulation (20x outlier) — filtered by median, consensus unaffected
- PEN-018: Governance vote with zero stake — `VoteStore` rejects `ZeroPower`
- PEN-019: Credential forgery with untrusted issuer — detected, distinguishable by DID
- PEN-020: Oversized payload (100KB ISO 20022 message) — no panic, size limits recommended at boundary

**Sandbox Seed Data**

- `scripts/seed-sandbox.sh` — pre-loads 5 wallets, 5 blocks, 5 identities, 3 credentials, 1 governance proposal, 1 contact entry
- Auto-runs after node health check in `scripts/sandbox.sh`
- Idempotent: safe to run multiple times

Tests: 1,604 passed, 0 failures.

### 2026-05-09

Audit status: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH, 0 MEDIUM, 0 LOW open. 1 INFO accepted (F-005).
Traceability: 8 PASS, 4 PARTIAL, 0 FAIL.
Tests: 69 pqc_crypto_module + 5 ACVP + 1427 lib = 1501 total.

**Pre-Lab Mock Audit Package**
- `pre_lab_audit/` — 9 documents: mock audit report, ACVP dry-run plan, IG checklist, clean-room build, entropy/RNG evidence, vendor evidence, traceability matrix, findings register
- Mock audit: 0 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH (ML-KEM placeholder, ACVP vectors), 2 MEDIUM, 2 LOW, 3 INFO
- Traceability matrix: 11/12 requirements PASS, 1 PARTIAL (ML-KEM)

- `scripts/clean_room_build.sh` — reproducible build verification
- `.github/workflows/pre-lab-audit.yml` — FIPS pre-lab CI workflow

**CI Reliability Hardening**
- `tests/test_seeds.rs` — shared deterministic seed constants for reproducible chaos/property tests
- `.config/nextest.toml` — cargo-nextest profiles: default (no retry), chaos (1 retry, 120s timeout), ci
- `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` — cargo-llvm-cov coverage report on PR + push main
- `scripts/ci_runtime_report.sh` — PR gate timing budget script (target: ≤15 min)
- PR pipeline runs fast critical gates only (no chaos/fuzz/benchmarks)
- Nightly pipeline runs full adversarial validation + benchmarks
- Fix: `fips_readiness` test correctly targets `pqc_crypto_module` crate

**Self-Auditing CI Pipeline**
- 5 GitHub Actions workflows: `ci.yml` (updated with PQC tests), `security-audit.yml`, `performance-guardrails.yml`, `nightly-chaos.yml`, `fuzz.yml`
- `tests/property_invariants.rs` — 7 proptest invariants (tampering invalidates sigs, equivocation always detected, hash collision resistance, serde roundtrip preserves PQC metadata, consistency catches all mismatches)
- `fuzz/` — 3 libfuzzer targets (block parser, signature parser, gossip message parser)
- `deny.toml` — dependency policy (vulnerable=deny, unmaintained=warn, license allowlist)
- CI env: strict PQC mode on all jobs (`REQUIRE_PQC_SIGNATURES=true`, `HASH_ALGORITHM=sha3-256`)

**CMVP Submission Readiness Package**
- `fips_submission/` — complete CMVP intake package for FIPS 140-3 lab engagement
- `SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` — 15 artifacts tracked (10 ready, 2 needs work, 3 not started)

- `CONTACT_PACKAGE/` — executive summary, module overview, 21 questions for initial lab call

**Pre-CMVP FIPS 140-3 Documentation Package**
- `SECURITY_POLICY.md` — finalized 13-section security policy (module ID, boundary, algorithms, roles, services, FSM, self-tests, zeroization)

- `build/module_boundary_definition.md` — files inside/outside boundary, enforcement mechanisms
- `tests/fips_readiness.rs` — 8 tests: pre-init rejection, approved ops, legacy blocking, state transitions, fail-closed, no-panic

**Approved vs Legacy Crypto Separation**
- Runtime guards on all legacy functions: `ensure_not_approved()` blocks Ed25519, SHA-256, HMAC when module is in Approved mode
- Guarded functions: `legacy_ed25519_verify`, `legacy_ed25519_sign`, `legacy_sha256`, `legacy_hmac_sha256`
- `approved-only` Cargo feature flag excludes legacy module at compile time
- 12 tests in `approved_vs_legacy.rs`: legacy blocked in approved, works before init, no fallback, API cleanliness
- `SECURITY_POLICY_DRAFT.md` updated with non-approved algorithm enforcement section

**100% Crypto Boundary Compliance**
- All 28 legacy files migrated from direct crypto imports to `pqc_crypto_module::legacy::*`
- `LEGACY_ALLOWLIST` is now empty — 189/189 files (100%) clean
- `pqc_crypto_module::legacy` re-exports Ed25519, SHA-256, HMAC, rand, ML-DSA raw access as explicitly non-approved APIs
- Boundary test fails if any production file imports raw crypto crates directly
- Ed25519/SHA-256 still available for legacy block verification, but routed through the crypto module boundary

**FIPS-Oriented Crypto Module**
- `crates/pqc_crypto_module/` — standalone crate isolating all PQC cryptography behind a strict boundary
- Approved-mode state machine: `Uninitialized → SelfTesting → Approved → Error`
- All crypto APIs reject calls unless module is in `Approved` state
- ML-DSA-65 sign/verify (FIPS 204), SHA3-256 (FIPS 202), ML-KEM-768 placeholder (FIPS 203)
- Startup KAT self-tests for all algorithms + continuous RNG test
- `ZeroizeOnDrop` on all private key and shared secret types
- No classical algorithm fallback — Ed25519, SHA-256, RSA excluded from module API
- `SECURITY_POLICY_DRAFT.md` aligned with FIPS 140-3 Security Policy structure
- 17 integration tests: API boundary, self-tests, no-fallback, key zeroization
- Workspace configuration: root `Cargo.toml` adds `[workspace]` with `crates/pqc_crypto_module`

**Post-Quantum Readiness — Full Stack Hardening**

Crypto-agility layer:
- `signature_algorithm: SigningAlgorithm` field added to `Block`, `DagBlock`, `Endorsement`, `AliveMessage`, `TransactionProposal` (replaces size-based heuristic detection)

TLS post-quantum handshake:
- `rustls-post-quantum` dependency: X25519+ML-KEM-768 hybrid key exchange
- `TLS_PQC_KEM=true` env var installs PQ `CryptoProvider` at startup
- `install_crypto_provider()` called before any TLS config is built

Dual-signing for migration:
- `dual_sign()` and `verify_dual()` with `Either` / `Both` modes
- `DUAL_SIGN_VERIFY_MODE` env var for transition policy

Equivocation detection:
- `EquivocationDetector` with `ConsensusPosition` key `(height, slot, proposer)`
- `EquivocationProof` with two block hashes + two signatures + algorithm tag
- Gossip deduplication, `receive_proof()`, `is_penalized()` quarantine
- Serde persistence (`to_bytes()` / `from_bytes()`) for restart survival

Slashing economics:
- `PenaltyManager` with `PenaltyRecord`, `PenaltyPolicy`, `PenaltyStatus` (Active/Expired/Permanent)
- Deterministic expiration at `start_height + duration`, permanent mode, escalation on repeat
- Anti-double-slash via `processed_proofs` set, reputation tracking
- Serde persistence for restart survival

- `tests/equivocation_persistence_partition.rs` — 6 tests (penalty restart survival, cross-partition retroactive detection)
- `tests/slashing_penalty_lifecycle.rs` — 9 tests (active/expired/permanent penalties, restart, escalation, anti-double-slash)
- `tests/performance_guardrails.rs` — 6 threshold tests (cheap rejection 213x faster, 4843 blocks/sec PQC validation, RocksDB 10K reopen 641ms)
- `benches/pqc_performance.rs` — 9 Criterion benchmarks (ML-DSA sign/verify, SHA3, block validation, RocksDB, flood rejection, throughput)

Dependencies: `sha3 = "0.10"`, `rustls-post-quantum = "0.2"`

New env vars: `REQUIRE_PQC_SIGNATURES`, `TLS_PQC_KEM`, `DUAL_SIGN_VERIFY_MODE`, `HASH_ALGORITHM`

### 2026-04-13 (Debug build stack overflow fix)

- `async_main` refactored into `async_main` + `async_main_inner` with `Box::pin` indirection
- The 1200-line async state machine now lives on the heap instead of the thread stack
- Fixes stack overflow that prevented `cargo run` (debug mode) from starting
- Stack size reduced from 64 MB back to 16 MB (sufficient with heap-allocated future)
- Release mode was unaffected (optimizations already collapsed the state machine)

### 2026-04-13 (E2E test suite compatibility fixes)

- Force HTTP/1.1 in e2e script to avoid HTTP/2 negotiation failures with rustls
- Prefer Homebrew curl (OpenSSL) over macOS system curl (LibreSSL) to fix `bad_record_mac` on POST requests
- E2E result: 104 passed, 0 failed across 26 categories

### 2026-04-12 (Security Hardening — P0/P1/P2)

**P0 — ACL enforcement on legacy routes**
- All 12 mutation endpoints in `api_legacy.rs` now call `enforce_acl` (mine, deploy, execute, connect, sync, stake, unstake, airdrop, wallet, nft metadata)
- `mine_block` verifies `miner_address` belongs to a registered wallet
- Debug `eprintln!("[DEPLOY]...")` replaced with `log::debug!`

**P1 — Double-spend and replay prevention**
- `is_double_spend` rewritten: matches by `tx.id` uniqueness across confirmed chain
- New `validate_timestamp` rejects transactions >30s in the future or >10min old
- Rate limiter: `/billing/create-key` no longer exempt; middleware logging via `log::debug!`
- Removed blanket `#![allow(dead_code)]` from `transaction_validation.rs`; per-item allows only

**P2 — Integrity and supply-chain hardening**
- Checkpoint files now include HMAC-SHA256 tag (env `CHECKPOINT_HMAC_SECRET`); tampered/legacy files skipped on load
- Chaincode install computes and logs SHA-256 of Wasm bytes; optional `expected_hash` query param for verification
- `jwt_secret` documented as reserved (not used for auth — mTLS + ACL is active)

**Tests:** 992 passed, 0 failed, 0 clippy warnings

---

### 2026-04-12 (Chaincode Install Fix)

- Input validation middleware now exempts `/chaincode/install` from the JSON-only Content-Type check, allowing `application/octet-stream` for Wasm binary uploads

**Dependencies:** `zeroize` 1.7, `proptest` 1.4 (dev)

---

### 2026-04-10 (Fabric Parity Audit + Enterprise Documentation)

**Structural audit against Hyperledger Fabric**
- Verified full Fabric feature parity across 6 critical areas
- Channel ledger isolation confirmed: `StoreMap` (per-channel `HashMap<String, Arc<dyn BlockStore>>`) used by all store handlers via `channel_id_from_req()` + `get_channel_store()`
- Private data dissemination confirmed: selective push to member peers via discovery service, membership validation on receive, `PrivateDataAck` responses
- Chaincode lifecycle confirmed: `Installed → Approved → Committed` state machine with per-org approval tracking and endorsement policy evaluation on commit
- Pull state sync confirmed: `StateRequest`/`StateResponse` messages, anti-entropy gap detection via alive message heights
- WebSocket events confirmed: `actix-ws` upgrade, `EventBus` subscription, channel/chaincode filtering, historical replay, client ack tracking

**Fix: proposals handler channel scoping**
- `POST /api/v1/proposals` now persists transactions to the channel-scoped store (was hardcoded to `"default"`)

**Enterprise documentation**
- `docs/ENTERPRISE.md` — Platform overview for enterprise evaluation (architecture, privacy, consensus, chaincode, endorsement policies, PQC, operations, use cases, Fabric comparison)
- `docs/PQC-ENTERPRISE.md` — Post-quantum cryptography positioning document for the Chamber (NIST FIPS 204 compliance, Fabric comparison, regulatory alignment, deployment model)

---

### 2026-04-10 (Post-Quantum Cryptography — FIPS 204)

**ML-DSA-65 signing provider**
- `MlDsaSigningProvider` implements `SigningProvider` using ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204, NIST security level 3)
- Keypair generation, signing (3309-byte signatures), and verification via `pqcrypto-mldsa`
- `from_keys(pk, sk)` constructor for restoring providers from persisted key material

**Generalized `SigningProvider` trait**
- Signatures and public keys changed from fixed-size arrays to `Vec<u8>` / `&[u8]`
- New `algorithm()` method returns `SigningAlgorithm` enum (`Ed25519` or `MlDsa65`)
- `SoftwareSigningProvider` (Ed25519) and `HsmSigningProvider` adapted to the new trait

**Variable-length signatures across the stack**
- `Endorsement.signature`: `[u8; 64]` → `Vec<u8>`
- `Block.signature` and `Block.orderer_signature`: `[u8; 64]` → `Vec<u8>`
- `DagBlock.signature`: `[u8; 64]` → `Vec<u8>`
- `TransactionProposal.creator_signature`: `[u8; 64]` → `Vec<u8>`
- `AliveMessage.signature` (gossip): `[u8; 64]` → `Vec<u8>`
- All hex serde helpers updated for variable-length byte vectors

**Runtime algorithm selection**
- `SIGNING_ALGORITHM` env var: `ed25519` (default), `ml-dsa-65` / `mldsa65`
- Logged at startup; unknown values fall back to Ed25519 with a warning

**Legacy transaction verification**
- `Transaction.verify_signature()` auto-detects Ed25519 or ML-DSA-65 by key/signature size

**Dependencies:** `pqcrypto-mldsa` 0.1.2, `pqcrypto-traits` 0.3

---

### 2026-04-07 (Fabric Gap Closure)

**Persistent Raft log (crash-tolerant ordering)**
- `RocksDbRaftStorage` implements `raft::Storage` trait with RocksDB
- Entries, HardState, ConfState, and Snapshots persist to `{STORAGE_PATH}/raft/`
- `RaftNode::new_persistent()` loads state from disk on boot, flushes after each advance
- Each Docker orderer is an independent process with its own persistent Raft DB
- Process crash + restart recovers full Raft state and re-integrates to cluster

**X.509 MSP enforcement**
- `TlsIdentityMiddleware` extracts CN/O from mTLS client certificates via `x509-parser`
- `on_connect` captures DER peer certs from rustls `ServerConnection`
- `enforce_acl` uses TLS identity as authoritative source, headers as fallback
- Role inference from CN: "admin" → Admin, "peer"/"orderer" → Peer, else → Client

---

### 2026-04-07 (Post-MVP — Block 3)

**External chaincode (chaincode-as-a-service)**
- `ChaincodeDefinition.runtime` field: `Wasm` (default) or `External { endpoint, tls }`
- Simulate handler dispatches to `ExternalChaincodeClient` for external runtime
- HTTP POST to `{endpoint}/invoke` with JSON body

**TLS Identity Middleware**
- `TlsIdentityMiddleware` extracts CN/O from `X-TLS-Client-CN`/`X-TLS-Client-O` headers
- Inserts `TlsIdentity` into request extensions for downstream handlers
- Compatible with TLS-terminating proxies

**HSM signing (feature-gated)**
- `#[cfg(feature = "hsm")]` sign/verify paths on `HsmSigningProvider`
- Verify uses `ed25519_dalek` with cached public key
- Sign path documented for PKCS#11 `C_Sign` (requires hardware testing)

**Already complete (preexisting)**
- Hot certificate rotation — SIGHUP + periodic reload already implemented
- Block explorer UI — Next.js app in `block-explorer/`
- CouchDB world state — `WorldState` trait fully implemented in `storage/couchdb.rs`

---

### 2026-04-07 (MVP Readiness)

**Graceful shutdown**
- SIGTERM/SIGINT handler via `tokio::signal` — drains HTTP connections, aborts background tasks, flushes RocksDB

**Persistent service stores**
- 8 of 9 services now persist to RocksDB when `STORAGE_BACKEND=rocksdb`
- New CF impls: `PolicyStore`, `CollectionRegistry`, `ChaincodeDefinitionStore`
- Added serde derives to `PrivateDataCollection`, `ChaincodeDefinition`, `ChaincodeStatus`
- Single shared `Arc<RocksDbBlockStore>` instance for all services
- Explicit failure: node exits if `STORAGE_BACKEND=rocksdb` and DB fails to open (no silent fallback)

**Health check with dependency verification**
- `/api/v1/health` now reports `checks: { storage, peers, ordering }`
- Returns `"degraded"` when storage or ordering is unavailable

**JS/TS SDK — Fabric-style operations**
- New methods: `submitTransaction`, `evaluate`, `registerOrg`, `setPolicy`, `createChannel`, `listChannels`, `putPrivateData`, `getPrivateData`

**Mutex poison recovery**
- Replaced 178 `.lock()/.read()/.write().unwrap()` with `unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner())`
- Prevents cascading panics across threads from poisoned locks

**Documentation**
- `docs/QUICK-START.md` — git clone to first transaction in < 5 minutes
- `docs/API-REFERENCE.md` — all 68 endpoints with curl examples
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` — production config, env vars, security checklist
- `docs/MVP-ROADMAP.md` — task-level breakdown for MVP delivery

---

### 2026-04-07 (CI Stabilization)

**Docker TLS permissions**
- `deploy/generate-tls.sh` now runs `chmod 644` on generated `.pem` files so the non-root container user (`rustbc`, uid 1000) can read them through the read-only `/tls` volume mount

**E2E test resilience**
- Grafana health check skipped when Grafana is not running (CI only starts blockchain nodes)
- Channel membership test asserts "not 403" instead of exact 200, isolating membership enforcement from downstream endorsement errors
- `POST /api/v1/store/transactions` now returns `status_code: 201` in the JSON envelope to match the HTTP 201 Created status

**Flaky Raft test fix**
- `three_nodes_in_process_propose_committed_on_all` routing rounds increased from 30 to 50, accommodating worst-case Raft election timeout randomisation on slow CI runners

**CI status:** all 4 jobs green (Check + Clippy, Build CLI, Unit Tests, E2E Tests)

---

### 2026-04-07 (Production Hardening)

**ACL deny-by-default**
- `enforce_acl()` now denies requests with missing identity, missing ACL infrastructure, or undefined ACL entries
- New env var `ACL_MODE=permissive` restores the old allow-all behavior for local development
- `enforce_channel_membership()` denies requests without `X-Org-Id` on non-default channels (strict mode)

**JWT secret from environment**
- `ApiConfig` reads `JWT_SECRET` env var at startup; falls back to hardcoded default only if unset

**CouchDB async client**
- Replaced `reqwest::blocking::Client` with async `reqwest::Client` in `CouchDbWorldState`
- Sync `WorldState` trait bridged via `block_in_place` + `Handle::block_on` (no runtime deadlock)
- Same fix applied to `ExternalInvoker` in `src/chaincode/invoker.rs`

**Configurable P2P buffer sizes**
- `P2P_RESPONSE_BUFFER_BYTES` — `send_and_wait` responses (default 256 KB, was 64 KB)
- `P2P_HANDLER_BUFFER_BYTES` — per-connection message handler (default 64 KB, was 8 KB)
- `P2P_SYNC_BUFFER_BYTES` — pull-based state sync responses (default 4 MB, was 1 MB)

---

### 2026-04-06 (E2E Tests, Operator Tooling, Full Service Wiring & Gap Analysis)

**All scaffold services wired to startup**
- `org_registry`, `policy_store`, `discovery_service`, `private_data_store`, `collection_registry`, `chaincode_package_store`, `chaincode_definition_store`, `gateway` initialized in `main.rs`
- `POST /api/v1/private-data/collections` endpoint added for collection registration

**Route registration fix**
- `ApiRoutes::register()` uses `.configure()` closures to break the generic type chain and prevent stack overflow from deeply nested Actix wrappers
- `ApiRoutes::configure()` kept for integration tests, `configure_metrics()` for production
- Main thread spawned with 32 MB stack to accommodate release + debug builds

**E2E test suite** (`scripts/e2e-test.sh`) — 42 pass, 0 fail, 0 skip
- Organizations, endorsement policies, channel isolation
- Block mining with multi-node propagation
- Transaction lifecycle (wallet → mempool → mine → block)
- Private data (register collection → write → read authorized → deny unauthorized)
- Discovery (register peers → query endorsers → query channel peers)
- Gateway (endorse → order → commit pipeline)
- Chain integrity, Prometheus metrics, Grafana health
- Store CRUD (identities, credentials)

**Operator CLI** (`scripts/bcctl.sh`)
- 14 commands: `status`, `peers`, `blocks`, `mine`, `wallet create`, `channels`, `channel create`, `orgs`, `logs`, `restart`, `metrics`, `verify`, `consistency`, `env`

**Fabric 2.5 gap analysis** (`FABRIC-GAP-ANALYSIS.md`)
- Detailed comparison: 12 verified E2E categories, 10 implemented-but-untested features, gaps vs Fabric
- Research-backed task backlog with code change requirements, blockers, and exact E2E steps
- Key findings: Raft is in-process only (no network transport), MVCC not wired to gateway, install doesn't create chaincode definition, world_state not initialized for snapshots

- Fixed `TLS_CA_CERT_PATH` env var name in compose (was `TLS_CA_PATH`)

**Route unification**
- Merged legacy and scaffold into a single `/api/v1` scope
- `ApiRoutes::register()` appends scaffold sub-services into the legacy scope
- `ApiRoutes::configure()` retained for integration tests (standalone scope)
- `ApiRoutes::configure_metrics()` used in production (metrics only)
- `health`, `version`, `openapi.json` registered as `.route()` in the legacy scope

**E2E verified**
- 4 nodes healthy, 3 peers each via mutual TLS
- Block mining on node1 propagates to node2/node3 within seconds
- 2020 unit/integration tests passing

- Serde derive en los tres tipos; módulo declarado en `lib.rs` y `main.rs`
- 6 tests nuevos; 531 tests en total

### 2026-04-03 (Fase 1–2 — Endorsement + Ordering)

**Endorsement (Fase 1) — completa**
- `src/endorsement/`: `Organization`, `OrgRegistry` trait + `MemoryOrgRegistry`, CF `organizations` en RocksDB
- `EndorsementPolicy` (AnyOf / AllOf / NOutOf / And / Or) + `evaluate()`
- `PolicyStore` trait + `MemoryPolicyStore`
- `Endorsement` struct + `verify_endorsement` + `validate_endorsements`
- `Block.endorsements: Vec<Endorsement>` (serde default)
- `ConsensusEngine::with_policy_store()`: valida endorsements antes de insertar en DAG
- REST: `POST/GET /api/v1/store/organizations`, `GET /api/v1/store/organizations/{id}`, `POST/GET /api/v1/store/policies/{resource_id}`
- `AppState`: `org_registry`, `policy_store`

**Ordering (Fase 2) — completa**
- `src/ordering/`: `NodeRole` enum (Peer / Orderer / PeerAndOrderer) + `FromStr` desde `NODE_ROLE` env
- `OrderingService`: cola `VecDeque<Transaction>`, `submit_tx`, `cut_block` con batch drain
- `run_batch_loop`: tokio task lanzada en `main.rs` si el nodo ordena
- `Node.role: NodeRole`; `Message::SubmitTransaction` y `Message::OrderedBlock`
- `process_message`: orderer ingesta TXs; peer persiste `OrderedBlock` directamente en store
- 525 tests al cierre de Fase 2

### 2026-04-03 (Storage)

**Storage — secondary index endpoint**
- `GET /api/v1/store/blocks/{height}/transactions` — queries `transactions_by_block_height` via prefix scan on `tx_by_block` CF

**Storage — secondary index `tx_by_block`**
- New `tx_by_block` CF in RocksDB; key schema `{012-padded-height}:{tx_id}` → empty value
- `write_transaction` and `write_batch` write index entry atomically in the same `WriteBatch`
- `BlockStore::transactions_by_block_height(height)` added to trait; delegated in `Arc<T>` blanket impl
- `MemoryStore`: equivalent linear scan over the HashMap
- 9 new tests (key format, empty result, filtering, no height bleed-over, batch indexing); 463 tests total

**Storage — Fase VI: `MemoryStore` + `Arc<T>` blanket impl**
- `Arc<T: BlockStore>` implements `BlockStore` — lets `Arc<MemoryStore>` be used as `Box<dyn BlockStore>`
- `ConsensusEngine::with_store()` persists accepted blocks into the store

**Storage — Fase V: store-backed REST endpoints**
- `POST/GET /api/v1/store/transactions/{tx_id}`
- `POST/GET /api/v1/store/identities/{did}`
- `POST/GET /api/v1/store/credentials/{cred_id}`
- All handlers return 404 when store is not configured

**Storage — Fase IV: RocksDB Column Families**
- 5 CFs: `blocks`, `transactions`, `identities`, `credentials`, `meta`
- `create_missing_column_families(true)` — compatible with new and existing DBs
- Block keys: zero-padded 12-digit decimal for lexicographic = numeric ordering
- 17 tests: per-type roundtrip, CF isolation, reopen with persisted data

**Storage — Fase III: switcheable backend**
- `STORAGE_BACKEND=rocksdb` → `RocksDbBlockStore` at `STORAGE_PATH`; default → `MemoryStore`
- Fallback to `MemoryStore` if RocksDB fails to open

**Storage — Fase II: RocksDB**
- `RocksDbBlockStore`: JSON serialization, atomic `WriteBatch`, `META:latest_height` tracking
- `rocksdb = "0.22"` added to `Cargo.toml`
- 13 unit tests with `tempfile::TempDir`

**Storage — Fase I: MemoryStore + API**
- `MemoryStore`: `BlockStore` backed by `HashMap` + `Mutex`
- `AppState.store: Option<Arc<dyn BlockStore>>`
- `GET /api/v1/store/blocks/{height}` and `/store/blocks/latest`

**Consensus — Fase H: ConsensusEngine**
- `ConsensusEngine`: wraps `Dag`, `ForkChoice`, and `SlotScheduler`
- `accept_block()` validates and inserts; `canonical_tip()` / `canonical_chain()` query state
- `ConsensusError` typed errors via `thiserror`
- 11 tests

**Consensus — Fase G: Fork Resolution**
- `Dag::subtree_weight()`, `canonical_chain()`, `resolve_fork()`
- `ForkChoiceRule`: `HeaviestSubtree` (default) and `LongestChain`
- 33 tests (22 dag, 11 fork_choice)

**TLS — Fase C: Certificate Pinning**
- `CertPinConfig`: SHA-256 fingerprint allowlist; disabled when empty
- `PinningServerCertVerifier` / `PinningClientCertVerifier`: verify CA first, then fingerprint
- `TLS_PINNED_CERTS` env var (comma-separated); absent = pinning off
- `docs/NETWORK_MEMBERSHIP.md`: pinning section with rotation guide
- 32 TLS tests total

**TLS — Fase B: mTLS**
- `build_server_config_mtls` / `build_client_config_mtls`
- `TLS_MUTUAL=true` + `TLS_CA_CERT_PATH`; explicit error if CA missing
- 2 P2P integration tests (valid handshake, server rejects client without cert)

**TLS — Fase A: TLS básico**
- `src/tls.rs`: PEM loading, `ServerConfig`, `ClientConfig`, `PeerVerification` enum
- `TLS_CERT_PATH`, `TLS_KEY_PATH`, `TLS_VERIFY_PEER`, `TLS_CA_CERT_PATH`
- P2P connections wrapped in `TlsAcceptor` / `TlsConnector`
- Dependencies: `rustls 0.23`, `rustls-pemfile 2`, `tokio-rustls 0.26`, `webpki-roots 0.26`

**CI**
- Added `toolchain: stable` to all GitHub Actions workflows (required by `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@master`)

### Changed
- Docs reorganized: `ANALYSIS/` → `docs/analysis/`, `Documents/` → `docs/archive/`
- Stopped tracking local `blockchain_blocks/` sample data
